    "### Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing is a sort of computer that uses the collective features of quantum states to execute calculations, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement. Quantum computing makes use of quantum bits, also known as qubits. Qubit can have the value of both 1 and 0 at the same time. Physical systems like as the spin of an electron or the direction of a photon are used to create qubits. These supercomputers are based on the quantum physics concepts of superposition and entanglement. Quantum entanglement allows qubits to be inextricably connected. Quantum algorithms may be more efficient than their classical counterparts in solving certain computer problems.These supercomputers are based on the quantum physics concepts of superposition and entanglement. \n",

    "### How does Quantum Computing work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers calculate the probability of an object's condition before it is measured. Operations in quantum computing employ an object's quantum state to generate a qubit. Qubits may have many states at once and hold far more data than a single bit. These are the features of an object that are unspecified before they are identified. Quantum computers are based on two fundamental concepts in quantum physics, Superposition and Entanglement. Superposition refers to the ability to exist in numerous states at once. A quantum computer with many qubits in superposition can process a large number of different possible outputs at the same time.\n",
    "Quantum entanglement is a sort of superposition that occurs when two or more qubits are in the same state. When two or more qubits are entangled, a change to one of them can have an effect on the others."
